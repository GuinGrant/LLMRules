Model Output:
Generate a nftables rule that log and reject TCP traffic to a specific port. Port: 5969, Log prefix: 'Suspicious activity: ' The rule should allow established connections. To generate an nftables rule that logs and rejects TCP traffic to a specific port while allowing established connections, you can follow these steps:

1. **Allow established connections:** This is typically handled by a rule that allows traffic in the `accept` state.
2. **Log and reject new traffic to the specified port:** This requires a rule that matches TCP traffic to the specific port, logs it with a custom prefix, and then rejects the connection.

Here’s the rule:

```sh
tcp dport 5969 log prefix "Suspicious activity: " reject
```

Okay, let me try to figure out how to create these nftables rules. I'm still learning, so I need to take it step by step.

First, the user wants a rule that accepts DNS traffic from a trusted IP. DNS uses port 53, right? So the rule should check if the source IP is 41.200.123.145 and the destination port is 53. The action is accept. I think the syntax would be something like: ip saddr 41.20 is the trusted IP, udp dport 53, accept.

Model Output:
Generate a nftables rule that allow UDP traffic on a custom port. Port: 6059. Log all incoming connections on this port with prefix 'Log: ' and accept them. To do this, you need to create a rule that log and accept. Also, create a rule that drop all other UDP traffic on this port with prefix 'Drop: '.
Okay, I need to create an nftables rule that allows UDP traffic on port 6059. The user wants to log all incoming connections on this port with a prefix 'Log: ' and accept them. Also, there's a rule to drop other UDP traffic on this port with prefix 'Drop: '.

First, I remember that nftables uses chains and rules. The default chain for incoming traffic is 'ip s' or 'ip input'? Wait, no. For UDP traffic, the correct chain is 'ip' because UDP is a layer 4 protocol. So the chain is probably 'ip' or 'inet'? Wait, nftables uses different families: 'ip' for IPv4, 'ip6' for IPv4, and 'inet' for both. Since the user didn't specify, maybe it's better to use 'inet' to cover both, but the question says "incoming connections" which might be in the 'input' chain. Wait, no, the 'input' chain is part of the 'ip' or 'ip6' families. Hmm, maybe the user wants to handle UDP in the 'ip' family's input chain.

Wait, let's think. The rule needs to allow UDP traffic on a specific port. So, the correct chain would be 'ip input' for IPv4, or 'ip6 input' for IPv6. Since the user didn't specify, maybe they want IPv4, so using 'ip input'.

So, first, create a rule that log and accept UDP traffic on port 6059. The log prefix is 'Log: ', and then accept. Then, another rule that drop other UDP traffic on the same port with prefix 'Drop: '.

Wait, but how to differentiate between allowed and other traffic? The first rule would match UDP traffic on port 6059, log it, and accept. Then, a second rule that matches UDP on the same port but perhaps with some other condition? Wait, no. Because once the first rule accepts, the second rule would not be hit. But the user says to drop all other UDP traffic on this port. Wait, that's confusing. Because if the first rule allows UDP on port 6059, then the other UDP traffic on that port would be those that don't match the first rule. But how can that be? Unless there's a typo and the user wants to allow specific traffic and drop others. Wait, maybe the user wants to log and accept traffic that is allowed (maybe with a specific source IP?), and drop other UDP traffic on that port. But the user's instruction isn't clear on that. Wait, the original instruction says: "Log all incoming connections on this port with prefix 'Log: ' and accept them. Also, create a rule that drop all other UDP traffic on this port with prefix 'Drop: '."

Generate a rule that accept HTTP and HTTPS connections from a trusted IP. Trusted IP: 128.16.246.139

Okay, I need to generate three nftables rules based on the user's instructions. Let me start by recalling how nftables syntax works. Each rule is part of a chain, which is in a table. The tables are usually 'ip' for IPv4 and 'ip6' for IPv6, but the user hasn't specified, so I'll assume IPv4 unless stated otherwise.

First rule: accept DNS traffic from a trusted IP. DNS uses UDP port 53. The trusted IP is 142.162.92.63. So the rule would check if the source IP is that address and the destination port is 53, then accept. The table is probably 'ip' and the chain might be 'input' or a custom one. But the user didn't mention a specific chain, so I'll assume a standard input chain.

Second rule: log and reject SMTP traffic from a blocked IP. SMTP is usually port 25, and the blocked IP is 129.24.113.155. The action here is to log the packet and then reject it. In nftables, the log action can be used with 'log prefix' to add a message, and then 'reject' to drop the packet with a rejection message. Need to make sure the rule is in the right place, maybe in the input chain, checking for the source IP and destination port 25.

Model Output:
Generate a nftables rule that log and reject TCP traffic to a specific port. Port: 8816, Log prefix: 'Blocked attempt: ' The rule should allow existing connections.

Okay, I need to create an nftables rule that logs and rejects TCP traffic to a specific port, which is 8816. The log prefix should be 'Blocked attempt: ' and the rule must allow existing connections. Let me think about how to structure this.

First, I remember that nftables rules are organized in chains, and typically, the input chain is used for incoming traffic. So the rule should be added to the input chain.

The rule needs to match TCP traffic destined for port 8816. So the condition would be tcp dport 8816. But I also need to handle existing connections. Existing connections are tracked by the conntrack module, so I should check if the connection is in the established state. That means adding ct state established to the rule.

However, the order of rules matters. If I have a rule that allows established connections first, then the logging and rejecting rule would apply to new connections. Wait, but the user wants to log and reject TCP traffic to that port, but allow existing connections. So maybe the rule should first check if the connection is established and allow it, then log and reject new traffic.

Okay, let me try to figure out how to create this nftables rule. The user wants to log and reject TCP traffic to port 7983, with a log prefix of 'Alert: ', and allow existing connections.

First, I remember that nftables rules are structured in chains, and each rule has a priority. The log prefix is set using the log prefix keyword. The reject action is handled by the reject target. Also, allowing existing connections means checking the ct state.

So, the basic structure would be: check if the traffic is TCP, to port 7983, and the ct state is not established or related. Then log with the prefix and reject.

Wait, existing connections are allowed, so the rule should skip those. So the condition is ct state != established and ct state != related. But how do I write that in nftables?

The syntax for ct state is something like ct state != {established, related}.

Okay, I need to create an nftables rule that accepts DNS traffic from a specific trusted IP address, which is 101.2.161.72. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, DNS traffic typically uses UDP on port 53. So the rule should allow UDP traffic on port 53. But I need to make sure it's only from the trusted IP. 

In nftables, the syntax for allowing traffic is usually something like: accept. But I need to specify the source IP, the protocol, and the port. 

Let me recall the structure of an nftables rule. It's usually in the form of:

ip saddr <trusted IP> udp dport 53 accept

Okay, I need to create an nftables rule that logs and rejects TCP traffic to port 3478, with a log prefix of 'Log entry: ', and allow existing connections. Let me think about how to structure this.

First, I remember that nftables uses chains and rules. The rule should be in the filter table, probably in the input chain. The action is to log and reject. But I need to make sure that existing connections are allowed. Wait, the 'allow existing connections' part probably means that the rule should accept established connections, but log and reject new ones. Hmm, maybe the rule needs to check if the connection is in a certain state.

Wait, the user said "allow existing connections". So maybe the rule should first accept established or related connections, and then log and reject new traffic to that port. So the order of the rules matters. Let me structure this.

First, accept established connections. Then, log and reject new TCP traffic to port 3478.

So, the table is probably 'filter' since that's common for traffic control. The chain would be 'input' because we're dealing with incoming traffic.

The rule needs to match TCP traffic to port 1434. So, the match would be 'tcp dport 1434'.

First, I remember that nftables rules are structured in chains, and typically, the input chain is used for incoming traffic. So the rule should go in the input chain. Now, the rule needs to allow established connections first. Wait, right, because if a connection is already established, we don't want to log or reject it. So the order of the rules matters here. The allow established connections should come first, then the rule that logs and rejects new traffic to that port.

So the first part of the rule would be checking if the connection state is 'established' and accept it. Then, for new TCP traffic destined to port 3203, log with the specified prefix and reject.

Let me think about the syntax. For the established connection, it's something like tcp ct.state == established accept. Then, for the new traffic: tcp dport 3203 log prefix "Blocked attempt: " reject.
