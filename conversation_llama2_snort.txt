Snort rule for detecting Drupal user login brute force attacks
Snort rule for detecting Drupal user login brute force attacks.
Detecting Drupal user login brute force attacks is an important task for any web administrator. Snort is a powerful network intrusion detection system (NIDS) that can be used to detect these attacks. In this article, we will generate a Snort rule that can be used to detect Drupal user login brute force attacks.
The first step in generating a Snort rule for detecting Drupal user login brute force attacks is to identify the relevant TCP and UDP ports. The default HTTP port is 80, and the default HTTPS port is 443. In addition, the default Drupal login page is located at http://www.example.com/user/login. The Snort rule should be able to detect any attack on these ports and pages.
The next step is to identify the relevant TCP and UDP flags. The flags that are relevant for detecting Drupal user login brute force attacks are:
The flags that are relevant for detecting Drupal user login brute force attacks are:
The Snort rule should be able to detect any attack that uses any of these flags.
The next step is to identify the relevant TCP and UDP options. The options that are relevant for detecting Drupal user login brute force attacks are:
The Snort rule should be able to detect any attack that uses any of these options.
